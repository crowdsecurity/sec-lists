# Plugin name: phpmyadmin-rule-exclusions
# Plugin description: 
# Rule ID block base: 9,513,000 - 9,513,999
# Plugin version: 1.0.0

# Generic rule to disable the plugin
#
# Plugins are enabled by default.
#
# They become active by placing them in the plugin folder. It is possible to
# control plugin activation via setting a variable. This can be done in the
# plugin config file here.
#
# The predefined variable name is meant to be "<plugin name>-plugin_enabled".
# For the phpmyadmin-rule-exclusions-plugin, this means it can be disabled by setting
# tx.phpmyadmin-rule-exclusions-plugin_enabled=0.
#
# Note that a global setting of this variable overrides the setting here.
# That means the "enabled" variable is only set by this rule if it has not
# been set before.
#
# Feel free to set the variable unconditionally here by replacing the
# SecRule line with an unconditional SecAction statement.
#
#SecRule &TX:phpmyadmin-rule-exclusions-plugin_enabled "@eq 0" \
#  "id:9513010,\
#   phase:1,\
#   pass,\
#   nolog,\
#   setvar:'tx.phpmyadmin-rule-exclusions-plugin_enabled=0'"
